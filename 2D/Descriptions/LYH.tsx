    <p>Hi, I am a React Frontend Developer from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      I have a huge passion toward Frontend Development because frontend is what
      people see in the first place. I believe first impression is crucial as it
      either makes or loses an opportunity!
    </p>
    <p>
      I always aim to produce optimized products with the most decent size and
      most efficient performance. I strive to make the most out of the least
      amount of codes while not compromising the product content and speed at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always believe nothing is impossible because even the word itself says{ ' ' }
      <i>I'm possible</i>. As the Law of Attraction goes, whatever I focus my
      energy on will be attacted to me.
    </p>
